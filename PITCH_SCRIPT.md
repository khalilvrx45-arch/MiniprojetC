# 🎤 Pitch Day Script: Pokemon Factory (5 Minutes)

## 📌 Introduction (1:00)
**"Imagine managing a global production line where every second counts and downtime costs thousands. Today, we present 'Pokemon Factory'—a custom-built industrial ERP designed for high-precision manufacturing simulation."**
- Show the **Dashboard**.
- Point out the **KPI Cards**: "Our dashboard provides instant visibility into factory funds, active machinery, and pending orders."

## ⚙️ The Core Workflow (1:30)
**"Let's launch a production. Notice how the system handles complexity."**
- Action: Go to **Commandes**, select an order, and click **LANCER**.
- Point to the **Machine Card**: "The machine immediately transitions to 'EN PRODUCTION'. We aren't just showing a static status; notice the real-time countdown. The system calculates the exact second of completion."
- Action: Launch a second order for the *same* Pokemon.
- Point to the **Status**: "The second order is automatically set to 'EN FILE' (Queued). No manual scheduling needed. The estimate for this order automatically includes the time remaining on the current task."

## 🔧 Automation & Maintenance (1:00)
**"A real factory isn't just about speed; it's about reliability."**
- Point to the **Usure (Wear) Bar**: "Every figurine produced adds wear. Once the threshold is hit, the machine enters Auto-Maintenance."
- **Key Selling Point**: "Our scheduling algorithm is smart enough to predict these maintenance gaps and include them in the delivery estimates provided to the client."

## 📊 Analytics & ROI (1:00)
**"Data is our most valuable asset."**
- Hover over the **Analyse de Performance** section.
- **"We automatically track our 'Top Pokemon' and 'Premium Client'. This allows a factory manager to make data-driven decisions on which production lines to expand or which clients to prioritize."**

## 🏁 Conclusion (0:30)
**"Pokemon Factory isn't just a game; it's a demonstration of a robust, state-managed system capable of handling complex industrial logic with a user-centric design. Thank you."**
- Final look at the **Statistics Panel**.
- End with: "Any questions?"

### 💡 Tips for Demo Day:
1. **Prepare Data**: Have a few Pokemons/Machines already created.
2. **Speed up Time**: If possible, set production times to low values (e.g., 1 min) so maintenance triggers during the talk.
3. **Show Persistence**: Close and reopen the app to show "Restoration from memory" (everything stays exactly where it was).
